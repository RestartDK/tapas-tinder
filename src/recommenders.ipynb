Located inside the Urban hotel, the restaurant looks very modern and is very stark, with concrete and wood paneled walls and tiles on the floor and not much decor overall. To be honest, this is not a romantic place to take a loved one to a quiet meal, as the dinner is basically a show that will require all your attention and senses. But what a show it is! We picked an 11-course meal, which was delivered by three very knowledgeable and attentive waiters over two and a half hours. It would be too long to describe every dish, so I'm posting the menu with the photos. While some dishes were better than others, none were bad and all were impressively tasty and amazingly good. Great job Yassin et al. We had a fantastic evening.",

Their cocktail program is really innovative and blends nature, terroir locale and custom liquor in a candidly simple but extracting complex flavors. Pretty phenomenal job by their team. My only suggestion to this phenomenal team and place would be to absolutely work on their ambience - I mean the interior vibe and furnishings they need to reflect their superior craft and thoughtfulness as well as playfulness, which doesn’t come through - if they do this they will be soon at the top of the world. All the best to you guys you are phenomenal and it was an absolute pleasure to experience your craft. Absolutely loved it",

         "Que guay. No clue if I spelled that correct. Raining pretty hard and found this spot. Was pretty tired, almost fell asleep on their couch.  Ordered some food. The food was alright to be honest. It was good, don’t get me wrong, but I wasn’t super impressed. The meat was pretty chewy but some of the dishes like the shrimp dish I had were solid. Paia, the dish with seafood, also have no clue if I spelled that right, was solid. First time I had that dish in Spain. Great atmosphere. Overall, great atmosphere but mediocre food. Give it a 5.8 which means 2.9 so practically 3 stars.",

We had the wagyu sirloin carpaccio, the Kampachi, the pork belly, the octopus and the shrimps plus 2 cocktails to start with, the Venenosa and the other ( I forgot its name ) was a Mexican take on a Negroni. Both excellent! We had a nice Godello to accompany our food, and a divine chocolate cake with mescal at the end !

         "If you can afford the place, it is well worth it. Located inside the Urban hotel, the restaurant looks very modern and is very stark, with concrete and wood paneled walls and tiles on the floor and not much decor overall. To be honest, this is not a romantic place to take a loved one to a quiet meal, as the dinner is basically a show that will require all your attention and senses. But what a show it is! We picked an 11-course meal, which was delivered by three very knowledgeable and attentive waiters over two and a half hours. It would be too long to describe every dish, so I'm posting the menu with the photos. While some dishes were better than others, none were bad and all were impressively tasty and amazingly good. Great job Yassin et al. We had a fantastic evening.",

Could totally see this as a great spot for friends to go to have a chill afternoon or drinks at night. Was pretty tired after a flight when I was here so keep that in mind. Madrid!",
