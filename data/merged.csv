Located inside the Urban hotel, the restaurant looks very modern and is very stark, with concrete and wood paneled walls and tiles on the floor and not much decor overall. To be honest, this is not a romantic place to take a loved one to a quiet meal, as the dinner is basically a show that will require all your attention and senses. But what a show it is! We picked an 11-course meal, which was delivered by three very knowledgeable and attentive waiters over two and a half hours.

I’m in shocked. And the thing shock me most was shrimp carpaccio with sriracha🫣 and sriracha taste exact like sriracha we buy from supermarket.

We opted for the tasting menu, where each dish came with its own story—some told beautifully through artful plating, while others left a bit to the imagination.

The unexpected contrast between the visual and the taste made the experience all the more intriguing. Alabaster is the kind of place that reminds you—sometimes it’s what’s inside that truly counts.

I hadn’t had a dosa since moving here. A proper dosa was what I had been craving.  We went today and had mixed raita, pani puri, rogan josh, vegetable biryani, chicken kovan and dosas. Chapati as well. It wasn’t spicy which I wish I had been asked about adding it but, it was aromatic, beautifully plated and everything was so fresh. I had communicated one dosa but received two but, they did not offer anything as recompense so we took the other home.  I’m not sure if the chai was made from scratch as it was very weak and not spicy or aromatic which was weird because everything else was so heavenly. After speaking with the owner/chef it was nice to know that all the meat was fresh and halal, not frozen and the menu was complimentary to all needs plus gluten free, vegan  and veggie friendly. Overall it’s clean, beautifully decorated and the staff are nice & friendly. The vibe was organised and peaceful. The velvet benches are a nice touch with the elegant mid century modern chairs  Atmosphere-wise, I feel there are missing elements of the culture as I expected textiles or art from Chennai, Kerala -just a glimpse. I would suggest this because it’s too vanilla. Show offyour culture as It’s an amazing one! In addition, I would have liked ambient music as well but, the tables and tabletop were elegantly appointed. I felt like this is a must for all future client dinners and my partners work luncheons because it satisfies all dietary restrictions & appetites. Thank you for an amazing meal and we are grateful for your hospitality - we will return. Many blessings and success to your business now and onward.

The quality of the food is excellent and the choices are varied so there should be something for everyone. Having said this, I had everything from the “off the menu” and all of the special dishes of the day. Although I thought their ingredients and preparations are of a high level quality and standard, I was not impressed. We asked for the main dish which was a part of the Tuna fish that is right behind the head and supposedly very prized but I didn’t like the texture of that part of the fish. It was slimy and gooey, so not for me or my friend with me either. Neither one of us enjoyed it. We also picked the salad of the day which was a mixture of three types of beans and also Tuna fish (I guess we were really in the mood for Tuna!) and it was fine. We also had a tomato salad that was also fine. I have to say that the service is excellent, the waiters do know their “metiere” and know how to present and sell the dishes to you, plus they made you feel tended to and taken care of.

My friend took a bite out of it, and found it weird that it wasn’t sweet considering she ordered it off the dessert menu.

Then when we got our bill, which included bread that had been brought to the table but we never even touched, we noticed a weird name on the list of things we had ordered.

Their house white wine was perfectly matched to pair with these delicious dishes. The shrimp could not be fresher. The garlic shrimp comes with a special sauce which is a bit on the hot side, but it was bearable. Unless you don’t like spicy hot foods.

1435,ChIJ79q3zoEoQg0RxfNO56LFts0,3,"I was really debating on posting but I am honestly surprised by all of these high reviews. I read that the grilled calamari and paella were recommended, so we ordered both. The calamari was good with this tasty tomato topping. The paella though, was way too salty and the rice was a bit undercooked. I could not finish my plate and had to wash it down with water. Also, it’s fairly pricey since they charged 18.50€ per person even if only one person wants the paella. I cannot confirm if this is true, but the aioli trio plate we had looked like it had been sitting out for a while (ours did not look as “fresh” as some of the pics I’m seeing here) and I saw the waitress dumping some old aioli back into the container bowl - I went to the bathroom and when I came back, I could see the 3 bowls of aioli just sitting out on the counter, no cover. That’s not very sanitary to me, but I guess no one has gotten sick. Some of the reviews also mentioned this, but I don’t like that we were charged 1.90€ per piece of bread (that we didn’t ask for!) and it was hard and stale and difficult to eat. There were only two other parties there when we came, so we were attended to pretty quickly. The service and atmosphere were great though. Maybe the other dishes were good, but don’t waste your money if you’re looking for good paella, which was what I was specifically looking for and was quite disappointed.

The menu is all shareable plates, and they have a tablet with the menu in various languages, definitely catered to tourists from all over. That being said, we enjoyed ALL the food we tried and thought the meal was very affordable for the quality.

We had sangria, cheese and meat platter, olives, padron peppers, chorizo in cider, and of course the unbelievably wonderful mushrooms. The great thing is that we could just order more food as needed, and we definitely got more of the mushrooms plus more cheese as we went along.

Again, the table was VERY small for all of us and all the food and drinks (we put our basket of bread on a nearby table for a while before anyone was seated there) but it genuinely made for a funny and fun experience, so just make the most of it and don't fret over the logistics too much.

The mushrooms are undoubtedly the highlight of this tapas bar! The stems are removed, filled with roasted ham, and the entire mushroom is soaked in garlic. They're served with two small wooden skewers, making it easy to eat without getting your hands dirty. If you don't find that delicious, I don't know what to tell you!

But the other tapas are also highly recommended. We tried ham croquettes, a mixed platter with Ibérico ham and chorizo, and a selection of cheeses – everything was simply delicious! We also ordered a pitcher of sangria, the perfect complement to this great experience.

Bread is served with the dishes, which is a wonderful addition. We recommend ordering several tapas and sharing, as this is the best way to enjoy all the fantastic flavors!

1538,ChIJrV93tSkmQg0RXI9ZwkWEyhs,1,"I was there yesterday, i had seared scallops with hot sauce. And monkfish baked in the oven with potatoes and herbs. I loved both the dishes. Both were very tasty, the monkfish i never had before and i really enjoyed it, even the taste of the potatoes was really good, everything is fresh and very good quality.

i finished off with a cheesecake which also was very nice. I am leaving in a few hours, otherwise i would have gone today to have the same menu one more time! And the owner is such a gentleman, it is a very small cozy restaurant. I do recommend it. Fix that main door though... Adios!

I am going to edit this review. But i will not delete the old one. I came one day early before a meeting just to eat in this restaurant, the food that i had before was incredible. However today the food was ok. The scallops were very small but good. The calamar was good, i didnt taste anything special, but the decorations of the plate was amazing, i loved it. The monkfish was ok, but the potatoes! Oh my god! They were burnt. I thought he changed the recipe so i trusted and ate it but no, i couldnt eat, i like burnt cheesecake if any of you know it, it is burnt, but it tastes good. It is very unhealthy to eat burnt food so i ate only once, however this burnt potatoes were horrible!. It is a shame because the taste of the potatoes was incredible before. Incredible! I tried to put the burnt ones to a corner but the taste was all over.  The juice of the fish also tasted burnt, i ate a little as i like to dip the fish in the juice, but i had to go due to my meeting for tomorrow and prepare, so i didnt send the order back. But no chef that respects the customer will send such food. I advise to the restaurant to Please always keep your standards same and respect your customers time and money.

Stop 3: La Comunal Olive Oil Tasting

Our next stop took us to La Comunal, a state-partially-owned establishment renowned for its high-quality olive oil. Spaniards consume about 10 liters of olive oil per year, a testament to its cultural significance, as our tour guide informed us.

We sampled three different extra virgin olive oils, each paired with bread. The tasting journey began with a light, buttery oil and progressed to more intense flavors. The darkest oil, notable for its slight spiciness, left a pleasant warmth at the back of the throat. Though not a traditional food, olive oil is a cornerstone of Spanish cuisine and a major export product. La Comunal offers these oils at great prices, providing an authentic taste of Spain's culinary heritage.

To start, the food menu is a range of interesting takes on some simple classics. Generally good quality, and some predictable items, but the menu is well designed in that you can have snacks or a full-blown meal if you feel like. Portions are reasonable and most items are easy to share.
This was my second visit, and the staples seem to be the anchovies on toast, the ""coca"" with sardines, tomato and idiazabal cheese, the bravas, the pluma and the langostines. The quality is good, everything is fresh and very tasty. We also tried the leeks, the fresh mushrooms, and the calamari sandwich - the latter two probably being the weaker dishes we tried off the menu.
They have a good wine menu and offer a decent selection at good prices. This is the sort of place that merits some bubbles and I'm glad to say they have a strong cava and champagne offering.
On the downside, the service was just ok - some confusion and general slowness with ordering and paying created a few delays, but otherwise correct and generally efficient in getting food out of the kitchen.

We were greeted promptly by the reception staff and led down a modern, LED-lit tunnel into the dining room. It’s very cozy with a 6-person chef’s counter and two, 4-seat tables.

We had the 14-course Omakase tasting menu. It’s a fusion of Japanese and Spanish influences with an emphasis on seafood…and of course smoke, for which the restaurant is named.

With the exception of the duck, the courses were creative, beautifully presented and prepared, and thoughtfully explained by the staff (who seemed conversant in at least English, French, German and Spanish). The counter had a primary server who was knowledgeable, friendly and helpful with the wine selections - we had several glasses, but didn’t opt for the wine pairing(s) which are available. I liked that the chefs would occasionally come out to explain the ingredients and preparation for the dishes being delivered. Wines were very good and reasonably priced.

Lots of local, seasonal ingredients in the dishes. Sauces were a highlight. Amazing execution and fun to watch the proceedings from the counter, with an overhead mirror of the prep area.

The food we had was quite good and paired well with the drinks they offered. I just wish the bar incorporated more of its rich history into the menu and perhaps added some stories about its past to the walls, which would make it even more interesting.

We enjoyed some wine—Riviera, which had a soft taste, and Madrid, which was stronger, according to their descriptions. Some of the other drinks seemed expensive at EUR 12, but it might be worth trying at least one. For food, we had Gilda Viva Madrid, Taco con carne, and Scallops with ginger—everything was delicious, and I savored every bite.

Be prepared to order in Spanish (which just means reading the menu and pointing when in doubt), as the waitress didn’t speak much English. This is also a plus in my book, since the place was more patronized by locals.

We had the house salad (Ensalate de Casa) which looks s bit daunting, but is delicious. Just be sure to pair the salty bits, like the anchovies and olives, with the tuna and tomatoes. We were honestly surprised by how well the flavors (tuna belly, tomato, anchovies, green olives, and olive oil) went together.

The chorizo is a must. In many places chorizo can get really salty, but this one was not. Very fresh, juicy, and the perfect amount of heat. Like the salad, the fries that came with the chorizo weren’t salty and added even more balance to the dish.

We also tried the tripe. It was not at all what we feared. No weird odor or “funk” to it. Super tender, but unfortunately, way too salty to enjoy even with bread.

1733,ChIJjTElVSyIQQ0R5J3uj1YKeOs,4,"If you're a serious foodie, you might want to consider my opinion

The tripe stew (callos a la madrileña) was stellar and a must try. It's not just tripe theres also pig skin and tendons all for a great collagen mess. All were reduced to mad sticky goodness and for someone who loves tripe, this is the stickiest stew I've had. Yes it's on the mild side but it goes w the free olives. Also, because it's so full of collagen it's really quite surfeiting after half a plate and I recommend you share this dish

Rice pudding had a nice aroma from orange zest and good crunch from the sugar but otherwise it was average

On the other hand, the eggs are really not it for the price. Yes it's good, it's tender and there's a nice aroma from the olive oil but there's no way you should pay 15€ for eggs and chips. That's crazy and the taste wasn't memorable

The oxtail stew was also good but not great. They got it to be very tender and fall off the bone, but it's not cooked in a sauce and so it's quite mild.

They were super nice to share a slice of jamon w me. It's got good complexity

If you come, come for the tripe stew which is a must try, and don't take other risks. Maybe the jamon only if u must",Yizhou Wu,Thursday,236,Casa Lucio,"C. de la Cava Baja, 35, Centro, 28005 Madrid, Spain",40.4120839,-3.709635599999999,Spanish Restaurant,"{""dineIn"":true,""takeout"":false,""delivery"":false,""outdoorSeating"":false,""reservable"":true,""userRatingCount"":9610}",1863.0,0.3000000119209289,9.399999618530272,-0.3250000067055225,0.0,-0.6000000238418579,0.0,en,"[""contentment""]",2025,2,20

1791,ChIJ__-_PokoQg0R9gKkTTUs3gI,1,"Terrible Experience – Avoid at All Costs!

We visited Azotea Forus Barceló as a group, expecting a nice dinner with drinks, appetizers, and main courses. Unfortunately, this turned out to be one of the worst dining experiences we’ve ever had.

We ordered tartare (both steak and salmon) as an appetizer, but all we could taste was mustard. Almost immediately after eating, we started feeling unwell. Even before we had finished our appetizers, the staff rushed to serve our main courses and began clearing plates while some of us were still eating.

The main courses were even worse. The so-called “pizza” had barely a drop of tomato sauce, making it completely dry and tasteless. The quesadilla consisted of nothing but dry chicken—no seasoning, no sauce, nothing. The pasta was the only thing remotely edible, but that’s hard to mess up.

When they came to take our plates, we immediately told them the food was terrible. Instead of addressing the issue, four staff members, none of whom spoke a word of English, became visibly annoyed and defensive. We tried to find a solution, requesting a partial discount due to the awful food, but we were left waiting for 20 minutes with no response.

Using Google Translate, we attempted to explain our concerns politely. However, the staff refused to listen, remained arrogant, and even threatened to call the police while glaring at us. After 40 minutes of frustration, we gave up and paid the full bill for the worst food and service we’ve ever experienced.

As if the experience wasn’t bad enough, four out of six people in our group vomited after leaving, and three ended up with food poisoning.

This place is a disaster. Terrible food, rude and unprofessional service, and zero accountability.

One downside was that if you’re not in the covered area of the rooftop (under the tapestry) it does get a bit cold if there’s some wind, the heat lamps were mainly under the shaded area.

As Americans spending some time in Madrid, we were offended and disappointed by a hotel chain that has always surprised us with its extreme customer service in every corner of the world: Four Seasons.

This weekend, taking advantage of the fact that we were passing by the Four Seasons Hotel in Madrid, we decided to go in and have a coffee. From the beginning we felt unwelcome:

- They took a long time to serve us, we had to call someone to come and get us.
- The waiter came and the first thing he asked us was the room number of the hotel, we told him we were not staying there and he quickly changed his attitude.
- He brought us the American coffee and tea we had ordered. It was to be expected that because of the place (and the price, almost 30 euros) they would be served with the appropriate teapot and a pitcher of water for the Americano. But no, everything was served directly in the cups. By the way, the smallest American coffee I have ever had.
- As soon as we finished our drinks, the waiter came over and asked us if he could take everything away, as if he was in a hurry for us to leave.

So that's what we did, we left with the idea of never going back to that place again. Such an attitude and service made us think that maybe the hotel cafeteria is only for guests, but then they should say so from the beginning.

An unfortunate experience in a hotel chain that is known for its elegance and kindness.

1846,ChIJc3SHJZMpQg0RxLiMtjl-9EA,4,"A Mixed Brunch Experience at QÚ by Mario Sandoval in Madrid

QÚ by Mario Sandoval, situated inside the JW Marriott in the heart of Madrid, near Plaza del Sol, offers an intriguing dining experience with a notable connection to the renowned two Michelin-starred restaurant, Coque. However, during our brunch visit, the restaurant left us with mixed feelings. Hopefully, a regular dinner or lunch gives its best.

Location and Ambience:
The restaurant's location is undeniably convenient, especially for tourists exploring the lively heart of Madrid. The modern and tasteful decor creates an inviting atmosphere, making it an ideal spot for a leisurely meal.

Food and Menu:
At QÚ, the brunch is organized as a set menu, which includes a variety of dishes and small pastries. While the quality of the ingredients used in the dishes cannot be faulted, our overall dining experience fell slightly short of the high expectations set by Mario Sandoval's culinary reputation.

The brunch menu, priced at 65 euros per person, offers a range of options, but the standout elements were the small pastries and desserts. The pastries were excellent and the desserts were arguably the highlight of the entire meal. The inclusion of jamón from the buffet was a nice touch, adding a traditional Spanish element to the meal.

Service:
Where QÚ truly excels is in its service. The staff was impeccably professional and courteous throughout our visit. They contributed significantly to the overall positive aspects of the experience.

Value for Money:
Considering the location, the quality of ingredients, and the overall dining experience, the brunch menu at 65 euros per person can be seen as a fair offering. However, it teeters on the edge of being slightly overpriced, especially when compared to the diverse dining options available in Madrid at similar or even lower price points.

Final Verdict:
In conclusion, QÚ by Mario Sandoval is a suitable choice for those seeking a flavorful brunch in a convenient, central location. While the quality of ingredients and the dessert section do not disappoint, the overall experience may not fully live up to the reputation of Mario Sandoval and his two Michelin stars. The restaurant's modern decor and excellent service are notable highlights, but for some diners, the pricing may make it more of an occasional treat rather than a regular haunt. It may not be the top choice for brunch enthusiasts in Madrid, but it certainly offers a unique culinary experience with a touch of elegance.",Rocco Longo,Monday,408,Qú by Mario Sandoval,"C. de Sevilla, 2, Centro, 28014 Madrid, Spain",40.416801799999995,-3.700126,Restaurant,"{""dineIn"":true,""takeout"":false,""delivery"":false,""outdoorSeating"":true,""reservable"":true,""userRatingCount"":88}",1984.0,0.5,13.199999809265137,0.5312500128638931,0.699999988079071,-0.1500000096857547,0.699999988079071,en,"[""contentment""]",2023,10,16

My visit to Delito Madrid was nothing short of extraordinary. From the moment I stepped in, the elegant yet relaxed ambiance set the stage for a truly memorable evening.

What really stood out was the impeccable service. Carlos, our host for the night, was nothing less than spectacular. His warm demeanor and deep knowledge of the menu made our experience feel personal and special. He took the time to recommend dishes and even shared interesting stories about the origins of some of the ingredients.

Now, let’s talk about the food—it was divine. The scallops were a masterpiece. Perfectly seared, with a delicate hint of kimchi that added just the right amount of heat and tang. Every bite melted in my mouth, and it was clear that only the freshest ingredients were used.

The highlight, however, was the seafood platter. The octopus was tender and flavorful, cooked to perfection with just the right smoky char.
Delito isn’t just a restaurant; it’s an experience. The attention to detail, from the beautifully plated dishes to the seamless service, made me feel like a valued guest.

Bars and clubs here in Spain tend to have their bathrooms in the worst condition so I was grateful that this bar maintained it so well. One con about the place was that the downstairs dance floor was EMPTY! My friend and I felt like dancing after a few drinks and we went to check it out and immediately came back up because there were only like 2 people dancing. I think the crowd is just older so they are less inclined to dance. If you want to party, this is not the place to go to.

As to be expected, quality is a function of price.

I couldn't finish a bottle anyway so it was a deal for me.

When I went back the next time, I asked for tintos that were similar in quality to the Valdeorras and they recommended me two Ribera del Dueros which were excellent too. Next I asked for their ""good"" blanco and it was similarly excellent.
