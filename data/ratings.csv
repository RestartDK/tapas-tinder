"3","ChIJaZxVboEoQg0R2Xyk4VBN6QA","5","If you can afford the place, it is well worth it. Located inside the Urban hotel, the restaurant looks very modern and is very stark, with concrete and wood paneled walls and tiles on the floor and not much decor overall. To be honest, this is not a romantic place to take a loved one to a quiet meal, as the dinner is basically a show that will require all your attention and senses. But what a show it is! We picked an 11-course meal, which was delivered by three very knowledgeable and attentive waiters over two and a half hours. It would be too long to describe every dish, so I'm posting the menu with the photos. While some dishes were better than others, none were bad and all were impressively tasty and amazingly good. Great job Yassin et al. We had a fantastic evening.","2024-09-30","Guillaume Slama"

"5","ChIJaZxVboEoQg0R2Xyk4VBN6QA","5","Amazing experience. We had the 16 course tasting menu and it was an absolute treat. Endless wonderfully crafted plates, explained with passion.

Great portions. Got some beef thing that was really good and crunchy. The goat cheese was fabulous. Overall, the tapas were good, not outstanding but solid. Could totally see this as a great spot for friends to go to have a chill afternoon or drinks at night. Was pretty tired after a flight when I was here so keep that in mind. Madrid!","2025-03-08","Alex Yang"

How This Place Is Not Got Huge Cues I Don't No. We Had To Wait Around Only 15mins. The Team Are Incredible And Make You Feel So Welcome. I Highly Recommend The Cod With Prawns I credible Mouth Watering Dish, Also The Corn Squid So So Tasty And A Must. I Had 4 Dishes To Share And It Was The Perfect Amount I Could Have Tried There Entire Menu. I Can't Wait To Come Back. Also Don't Leave Without Trying There Sangria White & Red.

"1","ChIJsTMCAocoQg0R2in-xQOdPwc","5","This bar will be in the top 50 bar in the world soon. Their cocktail program is really innovative and blends nature, terroir locale and custom liquor in a candidly simple but extracting complex flavors. Pretty phenomenal job by their team. My only suggestion to this phenomenal team and place would be to absolutely work on their ambience - I mean the interior vibe and furnishings they need to reflect their superior craft and thoughtfulness as well as playfulness, which doesn‚Äôt come through - if they do this they will be soon at the top of the world. All the best to you guys you are phenomenal and it was an absolute pleasure to experience your craft. Absolutely loved it","2025-03-09","Santosh Shetty"
"3","ChIJsTMCAocoQg0R2in-xQOdPwc","4","A place I would describe chic and cozy with a great selection of (small) dishes, well balanced and unusual. We ordered the ratatouille (absolutely delicious), the octopus curry (same), the potato salad and taco. We closed with a cheese plateau. The service wt the table was impeccable. The cocktails and the wine surprised us with the unusual mixed and quality. On Friday evening was not that busy. Great light and materials use in the interior. Nice attention to details (furniture, cutlery, dishes). Worth another visit when we are in Madrid.","2025-01-04","Cristian E. Nita"

It took us several attempts to secure a reservation, but it was absolutely worth it. The place is incredibly cool, fun, and vibrant. The service is outstanding‚Äîtruly exceptional‚Äîwith super friendly staff and entertaining presentations. The food is delicious; We tried the squid, rice, and feta salad.

Although the menu had a select number of options, they were all unique and tasted great (we tried the tortilla, bravas, croquetes, gyoza). I would also recommend the cocktails! The prices were also fair for the portion sizes and quality. Overall, a must-try place in Madrid ü§ó","2024-12-12","Mihael Kralj"

"3","ChIJiTGJRSomQg0RTD1MZa1RTnE","3","Que guay. No clue if I spelled that correct. Raining pretty hard and found this spot. Was pretty tired, almost fell asleep on their couch.  Ordered some food. The food was alright to be honest. It was good, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I wasn‚Äôt super impressed. The meat was pretty chewy but some of the dishes like the shrimp dish I had were solid. Paia, the dish with seafood, also have no clue if I spelled that right, was solid. First time I had that dish in Spain. Great atmosphere. Overall, great atmosphere but mediocre food. Give it a 5.8 which means 2.9 so practically 3 stars.","2025-03-08","Alex Yang"
"4","ChIJiTGJRSomQg0RTD1MZa1RTnE","5","Best tapas place I‚Äòve been to so far! The waiters were very friendly and quick with the service.

Service was quite average.","2023-10-06","Joshua Mei"

A must if you are a fan of cocktails. We will certainly come back to our next visit to Madrid!

A highly recommended restaurant if your looking for top class service the head chef always comes to visit your table and his vision for his menu is so on point highly recommend the stake, burger and prawns from hell! The wine list is well thought out but we recommend one of the magnums of red wine if in a group of 4!

We had the wagyu sirloin carpaccio, the Kampachi, the pork belly, the octopus and the shrimps plus 2 cocktails to start with, the Venenosa and the other ( I forgot its name ) was a Mexican take on a Negroni. Both excellent! We had a nice Godello to accompany our food, and a divine chocolate cake with mescal at the end !

Wait for food was quite long even though the restaurant was almost empty. I‚Äôm sure that the rice pudding was not homemade, straight out of a can. I ordered separate items and realised later that I had basically ordered the set meal, and then I noticed my meal was exactly the same as a person sat next to me, the same size portion, but they had ordered the set meal. When paying the bill the waiter tried to argue that mine was bigger but it wasn‚Äôt true. I could have ordered two set meals and had double the amount of food for almost the same price that I paid (‚Ç¨29.90 vs 2x‚Ç¨16.50). Won‚Äôt be back, low equality food and low quality service. Not recommended","2025-02-12","Sam"

We had this on our first day and it was so good that it was hard for others to compare. Each dish was unique and their use of different ingredients was truly inspired, as each element of the dish came together to form a single extremely deep flavor. Everything was so good that we could never choose a favorite. We were so impressed that so much food of such a high caliber was prepared by only 3 chefs in a tiny kitchen. We asked for wine recommendations and loved all of them. Service was very friendly and prompt in general. Comparte really provided an amazing experience for us.","2025-03-02","Dana M."

The only dish of the 9 courses that I personally did not like was the Topinambur. In my opinion this dish did not do anything special at all, and it was not up to par with all the other delicious dishes that we had( special mention to the Steak Tartary, the Albondiga de Pato, the pulpo asado, and the Molleja with beurre blanch, all outstanding !). The prices are very low for this type of restaurant , so it is worth booking in advance and go! And next time I will have the 11 dishes tasting menu !","2024-09-15","sergio valentini"

On one visit our order didn't come out gluten free so we needed to leave pretty soon since since bites were had, but they were busy and the server felt bad. Still go, just follow up with your order.  Such delicious dishes.","2024-11-10","Nikki Evans"

"1","ChIJnXNVR5spQg0Rme2Rv3TPPJM","5","I would give it 4 stars. Why? If you go to places like Gueyu Mar in Asturias o a Elkano en Getataria, you get a higher quality without the high prices, but ‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs Madrid, I understand. Since  1911 is a product restaurant that‚Äôs trying to be an elevated restaurant, I ‚Äòd recommend others like Smoked Room in Madrid, Campero in Barbate or Pepe Vieira in Galicia‚Ä¶if you want a more sophisticated cuisine, before  Dessert 1911. Again, it‚Äôs not a bad place, it‚Äôs a great meal, but you don‚Äôt get good value here, it‚Äôs just a good meal, not a superb one like in afore mentioned places.","2024-12-14","Pablo Fernandez"

They already have a Sol Repsol, the Spanish version of the Michelin Star. I would also note that the restroom is accessible and at the same level of the restaurant (no stairs) so it‚Äôs perfect for elderly people. There‚Äôs also an electric elevating platform at the lobby for climbing the few stairs in case of not being able to walk or finding it difficult.

The Spanish kitchen is not one I have much experience with - but quality work in a kitchen never lies. Style of this restaurant seems rather traditional - and thank you for that. Even the most highly regarded restaurants og the new age, will struggle to outperform honest and geniue food at its best.

The Paella and Gambas were very traditional and Spanish style.  The Pinoy dishes did not disappoint and were also very very good.  The crispy pata was very crunchy and juicy inside.

My meal choice this time was a disappointment - the grilled chicken was horrible, left most of it. It came in strange seasoning and was swimming in oil. Potatoes were cold and so were the tomatoes. I was expecting not to be charged for it, but I was. Nachos were average. Never ordering these meals again. Service was okay and so were the prices","2024-11-20","Sam"

"2","ChIJ9fMAJlkpQg0RYCrqLMvuM2Q","5","We arrived on a wet night so we were alone in the restaurant, but that meant that the owner gave us all his attention. I like to try and eat ""local"" food and there were plenty of items on the menu that were Spanish. We had a dish of sliced meats, Spanish sausages and of course an entrecote. All very tasty and some Spanish wine to go with it. Highly recommended.","2024-11-02","Herve Mamane"

"4","ChIJ9fMAJlkpQg0RYCrqLMvuM2Q","5","Great little steakhouse.  The food is kosher and excellent. Went there for my last dinner in Madrid with my colleagues and we were not disappointed.  Started off with the classic hummus and a Caesar salad to share.  Then each had the ribeye (medium plus) with french fries.  Excellent seasoning and taste on the steaks. Served with a chimichurri sauce that took the taste to another level.  If you are nearby, stop in and enjoy the food.","2024-01-26","Michael Torbit"

"2","ChIJzQ1p2r0pQg0R6ZULqAtsbns","4","Don Asador Parrilla Argentina in Madrid offers a warm, welcoming ambiance that captures the essence of an authentic Argentinian steakhouse. The restaurant‚Äôs decor, with rustic wood accents and soft lighting, creates a cozy atmosphere perfect for an evening out. While the food is decent, featuring a variety of grilled meats, sausages, and classic Argentinian sides, what really stands out here is the friendly, attentive service that makes you feel right at home. The staff is more than happy to guide you through the menu, offering suggestions and ensuring your experience is enjoyable from start to finish. The portions are generous, and there‚Äôs a good selection of Argentinian wines to pair with your meal, enhancing the overall experience. If you‚Äôre looking for a casual spot to enjoy a traditional meal in a pleasant setting, Don Asador Parrilla Argentina is worth a visit for its inviting atmosphere and hospitality.","2024-10-27","Dimitris Ladas"

While the meat and sauces were good, I felt like the meat cuts could have been better. Also the sausage was just half of one, so barely the size of a thumb. Sangria tasted ""okay"". Not great. Still a good experience!","2024-08-27","Chanaka Hettige"
"4","ChIJzQ1p2r0pQg0R6ZULqAtsbns","5","OMG!  This is a small restaurant, maybe 10 tables but the flavors are incredible. Prices are incredibly reasonable for Madrid.  We had the mixed grill. (Parriadas?). My BF is Argentinian from Corduba and a food distributor and he approves.  The Wine menu  little bit limited, but get the Cab over the melbec in my opinion. And do not miss the empanadas.!!! we had chicken and beef and they‚Äôre both incredible. Absolutely incredible.  Yeah the dessert was excellent as well.  And save the moment and look through the photographs in the restaurant they feature incredible famous Argentinians, such as Manu Ginobili!!  don‚Äôt miss this cute restaurant.  The staff are from Cuba! Honduras! And northern Argentina!","2024-08-31","Ellen Lin"

What a disappointment this latest visit was. Ordered the tenderloin steak. The cut I got served was definitely not a tenderloin! It was tough, cooked very unevenly and not rested at all. As a consequence, my fries were ruined as they became soaked with the steak‚Äôs running juices. In contrast, the roasted vegetables were nice. The waiting staff also deserve commendation. They were a friendly and attentive bunch.","2025-01-31","Patrick Mercera"
"1","ChIJV8NYARInQg0R93Q4K406XfM","2","Almost empty restaurant on my visit and the food was served quite quickly. Annoying that the waiter/ manager was permanently on his phone, hiding behind the desk/ bar area - so it was different to get his attention. I‚Äôm not sure why there is a fish tank in the restaurant, it‚Äôs a bit strange. I like ayran but seriously, a litre of it was too much. But it was cheap. Lentil soup was tasty. The condiments in dirty squeezable containers were not appealing. The whole feel to the restaurant was dirty and cheap. Meat was like eating leather. For the price it‚Äôs worth another visit, but I‚Äôll lower my expectations","2024-12-29","Sam"

The server promptly let us select our table and upon ordering had our delicious desert to our table in 15 minutes. It was ridiculously fresh and had an unbeatable flavor. I‚Äôd highly recommend getting the ‚Äúte turco‚Äù as well to partner with this dish as they compliment each other perfectly! I can only imaging that the meat and other traditional Turkish items taste just as incredible and authentic as this dish.

Then 27 days later, on our last night, we invited friends and had our last meal here as well. Sometimes, I find that good memories get distorted and attempts to repeat the magic fail. Not in the case of De Maria, we had another great meal. Excellent service, lots of complimentary additional touches; gazpacho, sorbet, almond cookies and liqueurs added to the extraordinary starters, mains and deserts. Small thing but the best french fries we had in our month to Madrid. Visit this restaurant you will not be disappointed.","2024-09-05","Paul Eddy"

"4","ChIJeVvDRHwoQg0RbluvAPHXSu8","1","Edit: WHAT a difference a year makes you'll get better service at your local Mc Donald,  the host needed to ask our names 3 times after being sited, the server threw the menu at the table and ask for our order without asking whether we would be having water or wine needed to ask for the wine list, the server dropped a tomatoe out of our carpaccio to the table and after been ask about it picked up and place it on the serving plate, when the water came he brought only one glass when they're were two people at the table an extra one needed to be requested, we ordered the Solomillo with mushrooms and roqueford, we're still waiting for cheese and mushrooms. The wonderful place we visited last year no longer exists. The food mediocre and the service is the worst I've had on a high price restaurant for years this place in my opinion has turned into a high price dump and will never come back or recommend ever again.","2024-11-03","Maria Morell"

Great atmosphere and very nice decorations. The service was excellent too. I highly recommend the pasta with pear and Gorgonzola (one of the best pastas I have ever eaten!).

It's on the pricey side if you expect to be pampered like a Michelin star restaurant or comparable price, but the local atmosphere and friendly people make up for it.

"1","ChIJg1LX4fEoQg0ROtFyf951QuQ","5","Although it lost its Michelin star in 2023, L√∫a is still a fantastic restaurant. The chef, Manuel Dom√≠nguez, enhances traditional Galician dishes with unique creative elements. It's an excellent stepping stone into haute cuisine, without the sometimes exuberant mannerism of more distinguished places. While you can order individual dishes, we opted for the tasting menu. Consisting of 2 appetizers, 3 starters, 2 main dishes and 2 desserts, it is adequately priced at ‚Ç¨92 per person. The quality is on par with what you would typically get in a traditional-leaning 1-Michelin-star restaurant. Our highlights were the peach gazpacho and the foie micuit with pear and caramelized cheese. While I'm not a fan of the traditional Santiago cake for dessert, the coulant version they make at L√∫a is amazing. The only thing that could be improved are the meat dishes: you can choose between suckling pig and squab, but both rely a bit too much on the sauce they are served with. Other than that, we had a great dinner in a relatively casual atmosphere.","2024-10-13","M H"

The service we received was incredibly friendly and informative, both elegant but approachable, intuitive to our needs. We chose to start with an order of  Foie Midcuit Sobre Empanada De Pera Y Queso San Sim√≥n Caramelizado, and a half order of impeccably soft and supple Pulpo a Feira. My companion ordered their Lubina con Verduritas, and I had the Verdinas con Carabineros, and the Raya En Caldeirada Sobre Sopa De Ib√©ricos. For dessert, I had the Brownie con Helado de Turron y Trufa (yes, it had authentic black truffles shaved on top) and my friend a ""deconstructed"" Tarta de Santiago. The whole meal was amazing; some of the dishes were elevated versions of traditional Galician dishes (the Verdinas or the Tarta de Santiago) while others were successful experiments (like the Fois Midcuit or the crazy-delicious Brownie with Turron Ice Cream and shaved Trufa).

We ordered the Pisco Nikkei, which was a refreshing blend of flavors, and the Spicy Margarita, which had just the right amount of kick‚Äîboth were amazing. We tried a variety of dishes from the menu, and each one was a delightful surprise. The Wonton Crujiente was a crispy, flavorful start, and the Croqueta Chili Crab was rich and indulgent. My favorite appetizer was the Japo Pani Puri‚Äîan innovative twist that was bursting with vibrant flavors. We also tried the 7 Potencias, a seafood dish that was as delicious as it was beautifully presented, and the Ceviche, which was fresh, zesty, and perfectly balanced. Every bite was an exceptional experience, full of bold and exciting flavors. The combination of expertly crafted cocktails, innovative dishes, and a warm, inviting atmosphere made this lunch one of the highlights of our trip to Madrid.

The menus offer a variety of dishes using offal from many different animals, and we were pleasantly surprised by some things we‚Äôve never tried. While I strongly believe you cannot go wrong with any of the menu options, I really enjoyed each dish from the Set Menu M, especially the dessert. The atmosphere definitely lends itself to a ‚Äúspecial occasion‚Äù if you want, but is not pretentious and is very welcoming. The chef goes around and speaks to patrons, which is just a nice touch.

Some plates were a small representation of bigger plates like arroz a la cubana and very delicious although we had a hard time with the waiters due to some of them not even remembering the ingredients that each plate had or mistaking plates and giving them to other customers more than once.  We spotted the waiters standing and talking quite a few times while we had asked for the bill and had to wait half an hour to receive it and waiting the same or longer to be served as well. Me and my partner left very much later than we intended to due to these inconveniences. Overall good food but poor service.","2024-01-25","Madelyn Salazar"

There is a small exhibition hall, where they had some interesting photographs and other artworks on display. I assume these rotate from time to time. There are a couple of the original greenhouses, which have tropical Flora and other beautiful plants on display. There is a large section of bonsai trees, not the best I‚Äôve seen since I have been to Japan many times, but it was nice to see these being tended carefully in Madrid. Definitely worth a stop on your itinerary if you have a few days in Madrid. The park/garden is quite spacious so dress comfortably and wear comfortable shoes.","2024-09-23","ESB NYC"

Although the food was good (not extraordinary but tasted good), I shall not be back and neither will my friends. After not even 1hr, one of the waiters (or was he the owner ü§î) came to ask us if we were going to order anything else (I wasn‚Äôt even half done with my plate and neither were my friends)! We asked him why and he mumbled something like ¬´¬†you‚Äôre taking a long time¬†¬ª. Like what?! How rude? We come to enjoy ourselves and enjoy the food but now you come and rush us out, pretty much üòí. Why? There wasn‚Äôt even a big line up front and since there is no reservation and I got there early on purpose to get a table and enjoy my time; I don‚Äôt find it fair to be rushed like that. If we had ordered only drinks, ok fair enough, you‚Äôre trying to make more profit. But we were eating! Anyways, after that I felt like the whole time this guy just wanted us out.

Pretty much everything has an egg in/on/around it and they have a few veggie/vegan options with vegan egg scrambles. The presentation of the food is quite eye-catching, so I was afraid the fruit pancakes would be a sugar-bomb, but the compote was a good mix of tart and fruity.

In fact you should not carry the Vegan label in your mind when think of visiting this establishment. You will enjoy the food whether you are non vegetarian or vegan or vegetarian. My regret is that I couldn‚Äôt fit in another visit while we were in Madrid. The eatery is reached through a set of windy roads. There is outdoor seating too. Ordered the homemade coli Buffalo wings to start. Cauliflower was exquisitely flavored with a unique spice blend, not Buffalo wings through and through but nonetheless very tasty. The tacos and sandwiches that followed were so good that if you took a test you would not know the difference between a veg and non veg dish. Awesome.","2024-11-03","Sanjiv Talwar"

But apart from that, I would definitely return, prices are on the high side and again I felt the staff offered the more expensive options rather than the more tasty ones.

The bao was outstanding!! The pork came in a hot pot and it was ‚ÄúDIY‚Äù. Delicious!!! The gyozas were pretty good too and the sushi was also okay. We tried the sushi that had mango, cream cheese and salmon and maybe this wasn‚Äôt the best one to try as it really felt like a mix of flavors. But still good!

They put us down there  it 's like in a small box , all the tables are close to each other and very small.The chefs are terrible. We ordered Gyoza Toro and Gyoza marisco both were cold .(what I said to the waiter, she said they shoud be  hot ) , but to us they bring cold , next dishes  Bao Eby  also were cold . Next they  brought to us sushi and rolls.The rice wasn't sticky, it was just falling (You can see in the photo how bad they did this sushi). If the chefs can 't cook rice , and the gyozas are given cold .. they shouldn't work in the kitchen .The service was very slow, the first dishes they bringef to us almost after 1 hour .And after 30 minutes we had to pay the bill , because the table reserve is only 1 hour and 30 minute‚Ä¶.

We got into the restaurant, were led to our seats, but a waiter didn‚Äôt come up to us until about 20 minutes later. We started to order and she told us that we have to leave in 1 1/2 hours because another reservation is coming in. So we order the omakase experience and it felt incredibly rushed. Like right after we finished the last bite of one thing, the next course was on its way to our spot. But not only that, we also fully felt forgotten. One of the chefs had to keep reminding the waitress to help out or bring us food. By the end of the meal, we got our dessert, which was fully melted, not how it was supposed to be (the people next to us had the proper way the dessert was served). And as soon as we finish the dessert, we‚Äôre handed the check. I go in my purse to look for some change because I wanted to pay cash and the waitress already has the card reader ready and in my face, even though I clearly have my cash sitting out ready.

I hadn‚Äôt had a dosa since moving here. A proper dosa was what I had been craving.  We went today and had mixed raita, pani puri, rogan josh, vegetable biryani, chicken kovan and dosas. Chapati as well. It wasn‚Äôt spicy which I wish I had been asked about adding it but, it was aromatic, beautifully plated and everything was so fresh. I had communicated one dosa but received two but, they did not offer anything as recompense so we took the other home.  I‚Äôm not sure if the chai was made from scratch as it was very weak and not spicy or aromatic which was weird because everything else was so heavenly. After speaking with the owner/chef it was nice to know that all the meat was fresh and halal, not frozen and the menu was complimentary to all needs plus gluten free, vegan  and veggie friendly. Overall it‚Äôs clean, beautifully decorated and the staff are nice & friendly. The vibe was organised and peaceful. The velvet benches are a nice touch with the elegant mid century modern chairs  Atmosphere-wise, I feel there are missing elements of the culture as I expected textiles or art from Chennai, Kerala -just a glimpse. I would suggest this because it‚Äôs too vanilla. Show offyour culture as It‚Äôs an amazing one! In addition, I would have liked ambient music as well but, the tables and tabletop were elegantly appointed. I felt like this is a must for all future client dinners and my partners work luncheons because it satisfies all dietary restrictions & appetites. Thank you for an amazing meal and we are grateful for your hospitality - we will return. Many blessings and success to your business now and onward.

We ordered the classic south indian foods like idly, ghee dosai, Vadai, oothappam, madurai chicken curry, chicken lollipop, prawn 65, mutton coconut fry, fish curry, chicken Chettinad, Parotta. Parotta with mutton chukka was my favourite. Everyone loved the food. Spicy chicken Chettinad was the ultimate.  No other indian restaurants in Madrid serve these authentic south indian food. Thanks for making me feel at home. Nandri!","2025-01-15","Ramarajan Subburaj"

After spending two months in America, I was really longing for some good Indian food, and I was so glad we found this place. The butter chicken was excellent, and the paratha was just perfect. The masala dosa was also top-notch! It's clear they prioritize quality, and offer a wide range of options, including vegetarian, vegan, and other dietary accommodations. It's a great spot to get that taste of home you might be missing.","2025-02-27","Piyush Patel"

The palak paneer I asked for did not look like a palak paneer at all, and the taste was absolutely not as expected (I have had this dish several times before). It had a looot of sugar in it and tasted more like a dessert than a dinner. The waiter was absent during our meal so when I told him about my bad food experience when we were leaving he replied that ""this is the way palak paneer is served in Madrid"".

Even the waitress asked him about it, but it didn't bother him at all. When I came back two days later, I didn't enter. Again, some bawlers were shouting so loudly that one could hear it from the street even with the door closed. And the food quality and service friendliness isn't worth it at all putting up with that noise. It doesn't have to be silent like in a monastery's refactorium, but also it doesn't necessarily have to be this incredibly loud. In general, it can be said that deficiencies in social behavior and intelligence cannot be compensated by volume.

"5","ChIJeZo1R4coQg0RomEiduJV2Ys","2","Firstly I would like to say that the staff were very nice and the restaurant was one of the most eye-catching places I've, however, it's my passion for Mexican food in which I must give such a low rating. Although this was the coolest looking Mexican restaurant I've been in the food was the worst, not to say it was bad just not good. Ordered Taco but I got something of a cross between Enchiladas and Fajita, was also very expensive. Would like to give five stars for the staff and the decorations of the place.","2021-08-16","Robert Hennessy"
"1","ChIJ3Zm_qeIpQg0RYPJxbjumIh4","4","The tacos are amazing and the low prices are unmatched. You know the place is good because there is always a line out of the door. The only issue is you often have to wait awhile to order and then are pressured to give up your seat to the next customer. This is just a consequence of their popularity. Overall a great food and I would recommend","2024-11-30","Vincent Praefke"

They got one of our orders wrong(the waitress repeated our order to us, but still entered something else into the system), but happy to correct it when we pointed it out.  Just more waiting.

Great restaurant!","2024-11-18","Isabella Jimenez"

"3","ChIJ7btnIyYpQg0RPVAbQqkycpo","4","Great food. The pasta was delicious and the wine (great options by the glass) were fantastic. My only complaint is they give you bread and water without asking if you want it or telling you it's not complimentary and then charge for it. It's not expensive but it's a matter of principle. Barring that small detail, the overall experience was amazing.","2023-09-17","R D"
"1","ChIJIaDjRJEoQg0RFBxY4toFsEw","1","Ten con Ten is a pretentious restaurant that falls short in almost every aspect. The main thing, the food, is excessively expensive for the portion and quality. They welcomed our group with (cold) bread and a small pumpkin soup that was given to us without asking, and we come to find out that is was charged. Service was mixed with some servers friendly and knowledgeable, and others lost and somewhat unfriendly. The space is well decorated and felt clean, but it was very small and crammed. All in all, if you are visiting Madrid for a few days and were thinking of stopping at Ten Con Ten I would recommend you do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.","2025-03-03","NMB"

The atmosphere was warm and lively, with friendly, attentive service throughout the evening. The food was diverse and flavorful‚Äîhighlights included the spicy sausage pizza, crispy aubergine, crab croquettes, and pork tacos. Each dish was delicious, well-presented, and full of bold flavors. The menu catered to various tastes, offering a great mix of textures and spices.

"3","ChIJu6JLYJcoQg0RaSU7Bs_Lb_o","5","I had tapas for dinner a couple of nights back. It was a work event paid for by the company, so (un)fortunately I cannot comment on the price quality ratio. What I can comment on is the food and the vibe. The food was great, and there was really a perfect variety of tapas. I actually hate sharing food, as I never feel I have eaten quite enough. But in this case it was okay. The Spanish wine accompanying the food was really good. After 11PM the tables were put aside and the real fun began. A concert from two girls who invited people on stage to sing with them. I didn‚Äôt understand any of the lyrics as it were mostly Spanish songs. But the vibe was amazing! I even got dragged on stage. Although I got out of singing as soon as they realised I was a gringo.","2024-09-21","Pieter Decavel"

"1","ChIJd-4jqGUoQg0Ri7UCUr8KiaA","4","Treze is a fine dining restaurant with a unique menu with very interesting choices, a great deal of seafood choices and for those with not such a large appetite as the portions are small. The quality of the food is excellent and the choices are varied so there should be something for everyone. Having said this, I had everything from the ‚Äúoff the menu‚Äù and all of the special dishes of the day. Although I thought their ingredients and preparations are of a high level quality and standard, I was not impressed. We asked for the main dish which was a part of the Tuna fish that is right behind the head and supposedly very prized but I didn‚Äôt like the texture of that part of the fish. It was slimy and gooey, so not for me or my friend with me either. Neither one of us enjoyed it. We also picked the salad of the day which was a mixture of three types of beans and also Tuna fish (I guess we were really in the mood for Tuna!) and it was fine. We also had a tomato salad that was also fine. I have to say that the service is excellent, the waiters do know their ‚Äúmetiere‚Äù and know how to present and sell the dishes to you, plus they made you feel tended to and taken care of. The atmosphere is nice and elegant but not over the top. It is pricey so be ready for the bill‚Ä¶ Then again, it is a Michelin star restaurant!","2024-06-21","Marilyn Sanchez-Osorio"

Cod & potato fritters to start were also good - nice crunchy, light fry. Had 2 different steaks as our main dishes, both were delicious.

The hostess and waiters were very charming and charismatic, but our waiter, Arpita, takes the golden star. She was very sweet and very attentive to us. We ordered a variety of plates, but the plates that stood out in flavor were the Pollo Alla Caccioatora and the Lasagna di Zia Lidia; the other plates (Risotto Frutti di Mare, Tagliatelle alla Bolognese and Gnocchi alla Vicentina) could have used more of the subtle Italian flavor/seasoning - to avoid using salt and pepper on the table, specially on the seafood dishes that need the soft flavoring to mask the fishy aroma). But the overall experience was nice, they even gave us complimentary ‚Äúchupe‚Äù (soup like shots) on the house. Arpita and the rest went the extra mile as well by giving us one of the desserts we ordered (Tarta de Queso) on the house as well, after they realized we were celebrating a birthday on the table. Excellent place for dining and wining!","2024-12-18","Samer German"

The Spanish tortillas, croquetas, vermouth, and beer options are simply all excellent. The quality of the food, the value for money, atmosphere inside, and vibe of the staff make Pez Tortilla an unmatched local spot in Malasa√±a. The menu is simple and everything offering is a good choice. The space inside is intimate, but it‚Äôs a great place to hang out if there‚Äôs space and you have a little time. Otherwise, they offer takeaway to enjoy your tortilla at home. I highly recommend Pez Tortilla, and will certainly be back.","2024-10-15","Patrick DuCh√™ne"

The place blasted old country songs which I actually like so that was a funny little treat. The place was really clean and the service was nice, so what else can you ask for from a ""Mexican"" restaurant in Malasana? Tacos are 2e and the tamales are 4e.","2017-04-27","Angela Chack"

The drinks were watered down with no taste. The Mediterranean salad with watermelon was horrible and the fried rice was really old. Overall I do not recommend this place for the price.

Then they took another tables order before us even though we arrived beforehand and were ready. The quality of the food wasn‚Äôt great. The torreznos came out burnt and the tacos lacked flavour and finally when they asked if wanted dessert we said yes and also ordered cocktails and because it was 11pm they said we couldn‚Äôt order cocktails as they were closing soon despite there were still people eating their meal. When we complained they told us next time we come they will invite us to cocktails but after our experience we don‚Äôt plan to go back and they should have tried to make an effort while we were there.

I don't even know what connection he has to the place if any. Took my daughter here in 2010 or so and returned with my two sons this week. The murals on the building opposite were new to me, and a great surprise. If anything the place was better than I remembered. The guy at the front was welcoming and took my reservation professionally. Every dish was excellent. The Limo de Buey especially. if there's any negative it's being charged per person for bread that we didn't touch, something like 11 euros. Sucks in Italy, sucked here.

"5","ChIJWeLWq3goQg0RTKBswSaAe5Q","2","Our experience here was a mixed bag. Off the English menu we ordered the roasted green peppers of Padron, and then under desserts the rice pudding and lemon sherbet with cava. Absolutely loved the lemon sherbet with cava. But we were puzzled when the waiter brought out the ‚Äúrice pudding‚Äù which looked more like like weird cakes with rice in them and something wrapped around them. My friend took a bite out of it, and found it weird that it wasn‚Äôt sweet considering she ordered it off the dessert menu. She stopped the waiter to double check that it was rice pudding and he just said yes and zoomed off. Then when we got our bill, which included bread that had been brought to the table but we never even touched, we noticed a weird name on the list of things we had ordered. Long story short, she then asked him in Spanish what it was and that is when he told her oh it was blood pudding. My friend was visibly surprised because he was just like oh you didn‚Äôt know like everyone just knows that. I have seen blood puddings on menus before, but looking at their site the blood pudding and rice pudding are in separate sections and she pointed to the one she wanted when she ordered, and she checked with the waiter! Not something I ever would have ordered and I did not like it, or the way they just brushed it off.","2019-10-05","Kayla Keller"

We booked in advance and stated it for a birthday but they didn't do anything which is fine. We ordered the roast lamb and garlic prawns which were delicious. The lamb was so juicy didn't feel like eating lamb as the meat is so tender and didn't have that gaming smell. My husband loved the garlicky prawns. Overall, it was a good experience although the price is too steep. My husband certainly wasn't impressed with the price. It's too touristy but I really did enjoy the old inn building and vibe. We were given two keys printed with their inn name as souvenirs. Not sure if they give all people. After all still highly recommended it if money isn't a concern for you.","2024-09-24","Chiliong"

I was alone in the restaurant but I had to call the waiter to be given a menu. Kitchen calls the waiters with a little bell (Dracuuuuulaaaaa is cooking). They called the waiter 4 times before he brought my food. I did not really like the starter, empanada de carne.

The service was very nice and attentive and the card seemed very good. We not ordered sorrentinos one with squash and salvia and the other ones with spinach and a mushroom sauce. Maybe ordering pasta instead of meat was not the right choice at an Argentinian restaurant but we were a little disappointed with it. Apart from beeing a small portion which can be ok if the taste is great but sadly that wasn‚Äôt the case with the mushroom sauce. It was not even a sauce but pure full fat cream without any flavour not even salt or pepper. Not even the mushroom had a taste.

Shout-out to the two waiters who were working on the evening of 12/3 as they were so kind and patient with us, and took the time to explain the menu, check in on us and have a friendly chat. They took my husband's allergy very seriously and made sure that dishes we ordered didn't contain anything that he might be allergic to, which we really appreciated about.

If you are in the mood for some delicious seafood and fish dishes, this place offers excellent choices and at a very reasonable price! It is located in the Ibiza area of Madrid, two steps from the El Retiro park and surrounded by an infinity of other restaurants, which are also very good. We ordered the chick peas with jumbo shrimp ü¶ê and the garlic shrimp, both of which were part of their specialties list. Their house white wine was perfectly matched to pair with these delicious dishes. The shrimp could not be fresher. The garlic shrimp comes with a special sauce which is a bit on the hot side, but it was bearable. Unless you don‚Äôt like spicy hot foods. We also ordered a mixed salad and I have to say that I have never tasted such deeply intense flavored tomatoes üçÖ in my life! Probably in Italy‚Ä¶ For dessert, we tried their passion fruit cheese cake üç∞. Oh Lord have mercy..! Incredibly tasty. I can‚Äôt recommend enough this restaurant.

The price was very reasonable including 3 courses and alcohol. However, the entrees were already a letdown, with bland and small portions. All of our main meals were very low quality, with the steak looking measly thin and tasting like rubber, the swordfish being incredibly bland, and the chicken being bone dry. The dessert was even worse, with the cheesecake having the consistency of tofu and the caramel pudding tasting bitter. I would rather they charge more or disclose the quality before luring tourists in, the chefs clearly put no effort into the cuisine.

Razor clam and scallops great. Sicilian octopus, if you like bonito flakes, you will like this dish. Tuna tartare ok. Overall not bad, above average. One thing i have to mention is i was eating alone and was the only person seated inside in the restaurant. I wanted to have tapas like everybody else but they seated me inside and i specifically asked if the menu would be the same and she said yes. But portion was not the same, so i doubt the price would be too. ü§î If you want to have small tapas, maybe sit on the high chairs at the front in the restaurant (not outside, cost extra) and just point to what others were eating.

The prawns were actually very dry (44e per kilo), the prawns were not bad (40e kg), the cockles and the legs were very good. I meant to catch barnacles and they flew away.

No issues there. Problem is food is so bland. I say this in the nicest way possible, but the flavors were not reminiscent of Indian cuisine. There was a lack of salt and spice (in general) with some of the dishes. I was told the vegetable curry was reminiscent of a ‚ÄúSouth Indian Thai style curry‚Äù which sounded good. I received it and was immediately in dismay. No pepper or spice visible in sight, but more importantly, could not taste any flavor. Vegetables were cooked well, not too soft or not too raw. That was a positive to it. My partner agreed with me as he stated his dish was bland and nothing notable. I guess I just expected more from a restaurant that‚Äôs well rated.

View is not thar great. Frankly, I was disappointed.  Wirth visiting, but the outside cafes ar street level are more enjoyable and the food tends to be better.","2024-04-14","John Boccuzzi"
"1","ChIJ79q3zoEoQg0RxfNO56LFts0","3","I was really debating on posting but I am honestly surprised by all of these high reviews. I read that the grilled calamari and paella were recommended, so we ordered both. The calamari was good with this tasty tomato topping. The paella though, was way too salty and the rice was a bit undercooked. I could not finish my plate and had to wash it down with water. Also, it‚Äôs fairly pricey since they charged 18.50‚Ç¨ per person even if only one person wants the paella. I cannot confirm if this is true, but the aioli trio plate we had looked like it had been sitting out for a while (ours did not look as ‚Äúfresh‚Äù as some of the pics I‚Äôm seeing here) and I saw the waitress dumping some old aioli back into the container bowl - I went to the bathroom and when I came back, I could see the 3 bowls of aioli just sitting out on the counter, no cover. That‚Äôs not very sanitary to me, but I guess no one has gotten sick. Some of the reviews also mentioned this, but I don‚Äôt like that we were charged 1.90‚Ç¨ per piece of bread (that we didn‚Äôt ask for!) and it was hard and stale and difficult to eat. There were only two other parties there when we came, so we were attended to pretty quickly. The service and atmosphere were great though. Maybe the other dishes were good, but don‚Äôt waste your money if you‚Äôre looking for good paella, which was what I was specifically looking for and was quite disappointed. As a big foodie, I am happy to pay for good food, but this was not it","2024-10-16","Vee Ngu"

Just come here and have a good time.","2024-12-30","Gabriel Cunha"

We did not have a reservation and decided to walk in based on intuition. They accommodated us and offered a free appetizer while waiting for the food order. We shared a very decent Mediterranean meal combination of cod fish and vegetables with a couple of glasses of wine at a very reasonable price considering the premium location of the place. Overall a solid A+ establishment.","2024-04-20","miguel org"

We started with non-alcoholic passion fruit mojitos made by Alex at the bar that were delicious and refreshing. The Causa de Pollo, Solomillo de Buey, and Fettuccine a la Huanciana all left us wanting more, so much so that we reserved a table to dine-in again our last night in Madrid. Andres was a wonderful sever that made the entire restaurant experience a delight. We were celebrating my graduation that night and he made a sweet memorable gesture to have the  dessert plate decorated. I highly recommend this restaurant and suggest you reserve a table in advance to guarantee a tasty delectable Peruvian fusion dinner when in Madrid.","2023-06-12","Cynthia Espino"
"5","ChIJuZ-oRmopQg0RpYDgNgBPwtw","5","Dining at 80/20 was an amazing experience. The atmosphere, the food, and the customer service were all exceptional. It was one of the many restaurants we visited during our vacation in Madrid, and the only one we visited twice. We started with pisco sours from the bar, which Alex made to perfection, just the right amount of lime juice and pisco sour. Our menu selections included ceviche, tiradito de salmon, causa clasica, and lomo saltado, and ended with the tarta de queso. All are must haves if you visit. Brandon is truly a master in the kitchen. We'll definitely be back soon. We still talk about the food we had because it left a mark.

"3","ChIJieKSiNQpQg0RZoUmD_ul7IM","2","Summary: disappointing. We had a reservation for 7 people at 19.00, and even though the restaurant was empty, they almost sent us back because we were a lot. Food was ok, except for the cheese plate (tabla de queso - not quesos), which came only with 1 type of cheese and costs 11,5‚Ç¨. That was totally a rip off and extremely disappointing. Then they brought the bill without us asking for it because our 1.5 hour-long reservation time was up. Even though there were still many free tables and we said we‚Äôd like to stay longer, they kindly kicked us out. Never going back.","2024-10-05","Hilal Bayar"

"3","ChIJi5Gu2oUoQg0RIwY2tgaLJ8Y","5","Our main motivation about picking this place was its ambiance. But additional to nice decoration, all the food was really good. The service was flawless. Prices are not above the level it should be. In conclusion it was a good experience. I have only one note: they are quite strict about 2 hour table reservation duration. I believe it would have been possible to give us a little bit more flexibility. There were quite enough vacant tables at 10:30 pm. We would have ordered some more food.","2024-02-24","Doga Ozyurekli"
"4","ChIJi5Gu2oUoQg0RIwY2tgaLJ8Y","2","The place has the aura of a 5-star restaurant, but the service is like a roadside gas station. For a restaurant that claims to be gourmet, serving toast with spoiled salmon was a big surprise. You can see by the picture how it looks disgusting. I only managed to eat the bread and eggs cause I was starving. The service wasn‚Äôt better at all, one of the waitresses rushed us as if they didn't want us there. The menu was very limited with only 6 or 7 toast options. The only thing that made me give it two stars was the orange juice with peaches, otherwise, go at your own risk.","2024-11-12","Debora Corbe Latorre"

None of the five dishes we ordered convinced us. 1) The tomato was still green and lacked flavor. 2) The crispy pork belly was too dry. 3) The eggplant was drowning in cheese, making it a really heavy dish. 4) The ""creamy rice"" was actually a risotto. Not a bad one, but the description on the menu is misleading. 5) The meatballs were the worst I've ever tried, completely tasteless and served with a horrible-looking sauce that mostly tasted like vinegar.

My fish had horribly cooked skin that was not near crispy, potatoes good. Tomato with the fish was just like tomato paste from a can, extremely dense. Herb oil was good but sparse. Minimal seasoning. The fish was edible but only parts of it. I hate flabby skin with no texture on fish. Butter came in water as ice melted. Dessert was dense with little relief. The flavors were not melded well on any dish. There was a lack of texture or a diversity of senses like you would pay at a restaurant of this price and quality. Atmosphere and staff were excellent. The food was just so below par. Edible but lacking flavor, texture and all extremely dense with little relief. Beautiful restaurant but food lacks depth nor a sense of balance from flavor to textures.","2024-05-28","Chris Mancini"

"4","ChIJqdVm2A8pQg0Ra4-eCgyYhDA","5","This restaurant, once an old caf√© bar, has retained its charming d√©cor and original paintings on the walls. Specializing in a variety of Chinese dumplings, including pan-fried and steamed options, along with a selection of Asian-style small dishes and noodle plates, it offers a delightful culinary experience.

The attentive waitress provided excellent service, presenting the menu with enthusiasm and readiness to offer recommendations. We opted for two lunch sets and an additional steamed pork dumpling, all priced at a very reasonable total of 33 EUR.

As an authentic northern Chinese dumpling establishment, this spot is a must-visit for dumpling enthusiasts. Each dish delighted our taste buds, boasting generous portions. Despite being open for only two months, its hidden gem status won't last long‚ÄîI anticipate it becoming a popular hotspot in the near future.","2024-01-30","Evan Kuo (Taiwanese in Madrid)"

Hummus has become an oversaturated menu item today but Barganzo‚Äôs tastes special. Everything we ordered was delicious but I‚Äôve been thinking about the stuffed courgette flowers since I ate them.

The Yemeni style brioche was divine as was the standard pita bread. The grated tomato, oil and labneh dip was the perfect complement to the bread.

This is a must visit restaurant when in Madrid and I think it may be the best restaurant I‚Äôve eaten in.","2025-01-03","Hannah"
"5","ChIJw4S4k_gpQg0Rw3VsJ45TTKQ","5","This was my first visit to Barganzo and I‚Äôll definitely be returning when I‚Äôm next in Madrid.
The food was absolutely delicious. The salad was well seasoned and fresh, the pitas were warm from the oven, and the stuffed vine leaves were exquisite.
The Hummus Barganzo was a little too salty to my taste, but it was well made and the portion was generous.
I do think the portion of stuffed vine leaves could have been a bit bigger for the price, though.
However, these were minor issues and overall we really enjoyed the meal.

Fair warning: Do not expect street-food prices. This is more of an upscale place with nice decor and high quality food. Be prepared to pay ‚Ç¨35-40 and upward per person (without alcohol).

Looking forward to a sister restaurant in Barcelona!","2024-09-23","Maya Eyal"

Our waiter, Christian from Romania, went above and beyond to ensure our dining experience was exceptional. His knowledge of the menu and attentiveness to our needs were truly commendable. He took the time to provide us with personalized recommendations, and each dish he suggested was absolutely delicious.

Christian's passion for his work and his dedication to providing outstanding service were evident throughout our entire meal. His friendly demeanor and kind personality created a welcoming atmosphere that made us feel right at home. He was attentive to every detail, ensuring that we had everything we needed and consistently checking in to ensure our satisfaction.

In addition to the exceptional service, the food at Abya was outstanding. The menu offered some options, and each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. The attention to detail in the preparation and presentation of the food was truly impressive. From the appetizers to the desserts, every bite was a delight.

The combination of the fantastic staff, led by Christian, made us have a great experience. I highly recommend Abya to anyone seeking a memorable meal in a warm and welcoming environment.

Thank you, Christian, and the entire team at Abya, for a truly remarkable dining experience. I will definitely be returning to enjoy your exceptional service again.","2023-11-19","moothy al rowaished"

"2","ChIJs-Rs1HgoQg0RIKgEqYXEer8","5","We had such a delightful experience here! Although they kind of stuck our large group downstairs, it turned out to be the most perfect and charming little nook, and it was probably less noisy than if we had sat upstairs in the thick of things. The tables were small, and the stools were backless, but it made for a fun experience for our group of six.

The menu is all shareable plates, and they have a tablet with the menu in various languages, definitely catered to tourists from all over. That being said, we enjoyed ALL the food we tried and thought the meal was very affordable for the quality.

We had sangria, cheese and meat platter, olives, padron peppers, chorizo in cider, and of course the unbelievably wonderful mushrooms. The great thing is that we could just order more food as needed, and we definitely got more of the mushrooms plus more cheese as we went along.

Again, the table was VERY small for all of us and all the food and drinks (we put our basket of bread on a nearby table for a while before anyone was seated there) but it genuinely made for a funny and fun experience, so just make the most of it and don't fret over the logistics too much.

Note that they do not take reservations.","2025-01-04","Victoria Kabakian"

"5","ChIJs-Rs1HgoQg0RIKgEqYXEer8","5","During a short trip to Madrid, we discovered the tapas restaurant Mes√≥n del Champi√±√≥n on TikTok ‚Äì and what can we say? We just had to go! In fact, we ended up visiting multiple times. Each time, we were warmly welcomed and always got a table in the small back area of the restaurant.

The mushrooms are undoubtedly the highlight of this tapas bar! The stems are removed, filled with roasted ham, and the entire mushroom is soaked in garlic. They're served with two small wooden skewers, making it easy to eat without getting your hands dirty. If you don't find that delicious, I don't know what to tell you!

But the other tapas are also highly recommended. We tried ham croquettes, a mixed platter with Ib√©rico ham and chorizo, and a selection of cheeses ‚Äì everything was simply delicious! We also ordered a pitcher of sangria, the perfect complement to this great experience.

Bread is served with the dishes, which is a wonderful addition. We recommend ordering several tapas and sharing, as this is the best way to enjoy all the fantastic flavors!

The location is cozy, the food speaks for itself, and the staff is very friendly ‚Äì even towards tourists. If there are language barriers, you can easily order via a tablet that shows all the tapas with pictures. This is a must-visit for anyone traveling to Madrid!","2025-02-23","Florian Kramer"

I recommend the red shrimp croquettes! Crispy outside and creamy inside. So tasty and unique. This was my first time having shrimp croquette.
Garlic shrimp was good too but definitely overpriced. ‚Ç¨17.5 for a small plate of small shrimps? Crazy! I had this dish in other restaurants that cost me less than ‚Ç¨10 and tasted as good as here.
The other downside is that there's a lot of trash on floor around the bar. I'm not sure whether it's the culture here but I found it quite disgusting.","2024-10-20","Li-Chen Lin"

Overpriced for tiny, dirty shrimp. At any other restaurant, you‚Äôd get a full plate of pasta with more shrimp, properly cleaned, and for ‚Ç¨5 less.","2024-12-13","Nikita Yefimov"

Octopus was super tender with flavourful eggs that had pieces of potato. The blue cheese croquettes had such amazing flavour, with apple sauce to balance it out. The blue cheese was not overpowering at all and made from a special region in Spain. The beef pie was really nice. I don't like doughy empanadas but this place had light pastry, nicely baked and fresh. Also got the Milanese schnitzel and that was super fresh too.

The wine selection is also remarkable.

The atmosphere is casual and comfortable, perfect for a pleasant and relaxed dinner. It‚Äôs the kind of restaurant you can visit often because it combines good food, excellent wine, and a welcoming environment.

The experience was very satisfying: the dishes were well-executed, with high-quality products. Some dishes impressed me more than others, but that comes down to personal taste.

"5","ChIJrV93tSkmQg0RXI9ZwkWEyhs","1","I was there yesterday, i had seared scallops with hot sauce. And monkfish baked in the oven with potatoes and herbs. I loved both the dishes. Both were very tasty, the monkfish i never had before and i really enjoyed it, even the taste of the potatoes was really good, everything is fresh and very good quality.

i finished off with a cheesecake which also was very nice. I am leaving in a few hours, otherwise i would have gone today to have the same menu one more time! And the owner is such a gentleman, it is a very small cozy restaurant. I do recommend it. Fix that main door though... Adios!

I am going to edit this review. But i will not delete the old one. I came one day early before a meeting just to eat in this restaurant, the food that i had before was incredible. However today the food was ok. The scallops were very small but good. The calamar was good, i didnt taste anything special, but the decorations of the plate was amazing, i loved it. The monkfish was ok, but the potatoes! Oh my god! They were burnt. I thought he changed the recipe so i trusted and ate it but no, i couldnt eat, i like burnt cheesecake if any of you know it, it is burnt, but it tastes good. It is very unhealthy to eat burnt food so i ate only once, however this burnt potatoes were horrible!. It is a shame because the taste of the potatoes was incredible before. Incredible! I tried to put the burnt ones to a corner but the taste was all over.  The juice of the fish also tasted burnt, i ate a little as i like to dip the fish in the juice, but i had to go due to my meeting for tomorrow and prepare, so i didnt send the order back. But no chef that respects the customer will send such food. I advise to the restaurant to Please always keep your standards same and respect your customers time and money.

I have old photos uploaded and i will upload the new ones. You can see the difference.","2025-03-13","marjan G."

The vendors were friendly and knowledgeable, happy to offer recommendations. The quality of the products, especially the fresh produce and seafood, was outstanding. Prices were reasonable for the quality, though some stalls felt slightly on the pricier side.

The only downside was that it got quite crowded during peak hours, which made finding a spot to sit a bit challenging. Still, the energy and charm of the place made up for it.

At our second stop, we visited R Garcia, a charming jamoneria run by Jose and his son Jimmy. The highlight here was an exquisite tasting of three different types of cured hams, paired perfectly with a refreshing beer.

Jose expertly carved and served the ham, showcasing his skill and passion for this traditional craft. Our tour guide, Simon, explained the quality distinctions among the hams, noting that the black label ham is considered the finest. Among the cuts, the Lomo, which are the middle slices in the photo, stood out as exceptionally delicious, offering a rich and flavorful experience.

Our next stop is a tasting of olive oil at La Comunal, which partly owned by the state. Our tour guide sais Spaniards consume about 10L of olive oil per year. We tasted 3 different extra virfin olive oils with bread. Each one had a buttery flavor each one more intense than the prior. The darkest oil had a slight spiciness that hit you in the back of the throat. Although this isn't food, it's a great way to experience one of the big export products of Spain. Oils at great prices and a good way to experience the culture.

Stop 3: La Comunal Olive Oil Tasting

Our next stop took us to La Comunal, a state-partially-owned establishment renowned for its high-quality olive oil. Spaniards consume about 10 liters of olive oil per year, a testament to its cultural significance, as our tour guide informed us.

We sampled three different extra virgin olive oils, each paired with bread. The tasting journey began with a light, buttery oil and progressed to more intense flavors. The darkest oil, notable for its slight spiciness, left a pleasant warmth at the back of the throat. Though not a traditional food, olive oil is a cornerstone of Spanish cuisine and a major export product. La Comunal offers these oils at great prices, providing an authentic taste of Spain's culinary heritage.

The next stop on our tour is the local market named Mercado Barcello. Many fresh foods are available in using fruits, vegetables,cheese, ham, poultry, beef, fish and pork. You can also buy wine, oils, baked goods and prepared foods for lunch.
We stopped at the fish market and bought seabass, which they will cook for lunch for us at the Bistro. This market is used primarily by locals daily to stock their homes for the weekly meals. We were able to get samples at the fruit market and everything tasted so sweet and good. We sampled olives and chips with anchovies. We sampled cheeses. Spain makes more than 150 variety of cheese made with cow, sheep and Goat milk. If you're looking to see and experience food culture in Madrid, you should stop at this market.

I ended up getting a spinach and ricotta empanada from a shop (whose name I unfortunately forgot but near the entrance) and was not happy with the service. The empanada however, was delicious and kept me filled the entire day.","2024-10-09","S"

"3","ChIJseuc2DQpQg0RU9WxcDLQmPY","4","Mimicking a classic bar with its diner-style bar, comfy booths and lots of spaces with stools, Trafalgar is a trendy and sociable spot on the side streets around Olavide / Cardenal Cisneros. Super discreet from the outside, and although it's big, it can be easy to miss!
To start, the food menu is a range of interesting takes on some simple classics. Generally good quality, and some predictable items, but the menu is well designed in that you can have snacks or a full-blown meal if you feel like. Portions are reasonable and most items are easy to share.
This was my second visit, and the staples seem to be the anchovies on toast, the ""coca"" with sardines, tomato and idiazabal cheese, the bravas, the pluma and the langostines. The quality is good, everything is fresh and very tasty. We also tried the leeks, the fresh mushrooms, and the calamari sandwich - the latter two probably being the weaker dishes we tried off the menu.
They have a good wine menu and offer a decent selection at good prices. This is the sort of place that merits some bubbles and I'm glad to say they have a strong cava and champagne offering.
On the downside, the service was just ok - some confusion and general slowness with ordering and paying created a few delays, but otherwise correct and generally efficient in getting food out of the kitchen.
Overall, Trafalgar has a good vibe - comfortable but buzzing. Definitely worth a (return) visit.","2025-01-24","Thomas John McMaw"

The service was outstanding and fast. The breads that came with the sausages are additional charge. So if you don't want, you need to ask to send them back. I knew they charge and the sausages were delicious. 5/5

Callos 4/5. The callos was so rich. I would need to dip with bread. It was too rich to be eaten alone. I'm not sure how to eat this stew by itself.

Salmon croquettes 4/5. The croquettes were super cheesy so it really depends on your taste. The meal was so full and was intended to be shared.

At the end, the restaurant gave us free coffee shot. It was the first time some restaurant in Madrid even gave out something free.

We were greeted promptly by the reception staff and led down a modern, LED-lit tunnel into the dining room. It‚Äôs very cozy with a 6-person chef‚Äôs counter and two, 4-seat tables.

We had the 14-course Omakase tasting menu. It‚Äôs a fusion of Japanese and Spanish influences with an emphasis on seafood‚Ä¶and of course smoke, for which the restaurant is named.

With the exception of the duck, the courses were creative, beautifully presented and prepared, and thoughtfully explained by the staff (who seemed conversant in at least English, French, German and Spanish). The counter had a primary server who was knowledgeable, friendly and helpful with the wine selections - we had several glasses, but didn‚Äôt opt for the wine pairing(s) which are available. I liked that the chefs would occasionally come out to explain the ingredients and preparation for the dishes being delivered. Wines were very good and reasonably priced.

Lots of local, seasonal ingredients in the dishes. Sauces were a highlight. Amazing execution and fun to watch the proceedings from the counter, with an overhead mirror of the prep area.

We went for the Mexican and hot dogs and they were good quality, but everything was just a bit cold. They have an app / tablet ordering system for the whole market which seems efficient in principle, but wastes a bit of time between preparing and receiving the food. All in all it was a bit impersonal and everything wasn't as hot as you'd expect. Nice space, but unfortunately no real service.","2024-04-08","Thomas John McMaw"

I also got panko chicken, which I put in the air fryer, and it came out so good. I also bought some essential Asian ingredients. The prices are so reasonable, and I know I will be back.

The food we had was quite good and paired well with the drinks they offered. I just wish the bar incorporated more of its rich history into the menu and perhaps added some stories about its past to the walls, which would make it even more interesting.

We enjoyed some wine‚ÄîRiviera, which had a soft taste, and Madrid, which was stronger, according to their descriptions. Some of the other drinks seemed expensive at EUR 12, but it might be worth trying at least one. For food, we had Gilda Viva Madrid, Taco con carne, and Scallops with ginger‚Äîeverything was delicious, and I savored every bite.

The place offers outdoor, bar, and indoor seating. The indoor area is more suited for eating and drinking, with a great vibe and a perfect spot to hang out with friends.

"1","ChIJfUu6XIIoQg0Rb79ey-fvRy4","4","This is a great little taverna that is away from the crowded tourist streets and restaurants of Madrid.

Be prepared to order in Spanish (which just means reading the menu and pointing when in doubt), as the waitress didn‚Äôt speak much English. This is also a plus in my book, since the place was more patronized by locals.

We had the house salad (Ensalate de Casa) which looks s bit daunting, but is delicious. Just be sure to pair the salty bits, like the anchovies and olives, with the tuna and tomatoes. We were honestly surprised by how well the flavors (tuna belly, tomato, anchovies, green olives, and olive oil) went together.

The chorizo is a must. In many places chorizo can get really salty, but this one was not. Very fresh, juicy, and the perfect amount of heat. Like the salad, the fries that came with the chorizo weren‚Äôt salty and added even more balance to the dish.

We also tried the tripe. It was not at all what we feared. No weird odor or ‚Äúfunk‚Äù to it. Super tender, but unfortunately, way too salty to enjoy even with bread.

I can't say enough about how professional and knowledgeable and kind the owners were. The wine and the rum that I had were at an accessible price (I don't remember exactly, but it couldn't have been more than 4 Euros for a glass of wine and maybe 7 Euros for the mixed drink?

"1","ChIJS6RrDyomQg0RfuacppbbFlU","3","We got there at 8:19pm on a march friday night and already there were about 10 people lined up.  Pretty much everyone that got there by 8:25pm or so got a table as they do have a rather large seating area.  You can preview the menu outside their front door while you wait.  Two of us had the fancier 32E 2 course meal, and another had the more simple 16E 3 course meal.  For apps we had the house made croquettes, battered eggplant, and cooked chard (actually tasty).  Comes with rather dry table bread.  For mains my T bone steak had a nice crust and had decent seasoning, but for a steak barely 1.5 cm thick, the insides were almost raw.  The quality of the steak was also quite poor.  Lamb chops were very thin (under 1cm) but tasted good and were cooked all the way thru.  My wife had the tripe dish served stew like but it was way overcooked and mushy (I like a bit of chew in my tripe).  The fries were hot but not quite crispy enough for my liking.  For dessert we had a cooked banana with whipped cream and chocolate.  Wine was the bottle shown in my photo, which tasted like a cheap red wine that I would use for cooking.  Overall a quick and hearty meal with large portions and affordable, but don't expect expertly prepared dishes to come to your table.","2025-03-14","Ray and Limai"

The restaurant has many 3-course-meal packages to select and each of them has many choices. The local food served were tasty. The waiter are very attentive, although they don't speak very good English, but they're very friendly.

My wife and I had a dinner with 36 euros, that's very cheap isn't it?! Too bad we didn't have second chance to come back and taste other menu during our trip.","2024-12-10","Yen Han Tan"

"2","ChIJjTElVSyIQQ0R5J3uj1YKeOs","4","If you're a serious foodie, you might want to consider my opinion

The tripe stew (callos a la madrile√±a) was stellar and a must try. It's not just tripe theres also pig skin and tendons all for a great collagen mess. All were reduced to mad sticky goodness and for someone who loves tripe, this is the stickiest stew I've had. Yes it's on the mild side but it goes w the free olives. Also, because it's so full of collagen it's really quite surfeiting after half a plate and I recommend you share this dish

Rice pudding had a nice aroma from orange zest and good crunch from the sugar but otherwise it was average

On the other hand, the eggs are really not it for the price. Yes it's good, it's tender and there's a nice aroma from the olive oil but there's no way you should pay 15‚Ç¨ for eggs and chips. That's crazy and the taste wasn't memorable

The oxtail stew was also good but not great. They got it to be very tender and fall off the bone, but it's not cooked in a sauce and so it's quite mild.

They were super nice to share a slice of jamon w me. It's got good complexity

If you come, come for the tripe stew which is a must try, and don't take other risks. Maybe the jamon only if u must","2025-02-20","Yizhou Wu"

Menu has a limited choice. If you are with kids probably nothing they will eat. Prices are quite high - small Coke 5 EUR.

However service‚Ä¶OMG‚Ä¶if management of staff reads this please remind your members of staff to be somewhat polite to customers and be less arrogant as they work there.

"1","ChIJ__-_PokoQg0R9gKkTTUs3gI","1","Terrible Experience ‚Äì Avoid at All Costs!

We visited Azotea Forus Barcel√≥ as a group, expecting a nice dinner with drinks, appetizers, and main courses. Unfortunately, this turned out to be one of the worst dining experiences we‚Äôve ever had.

We ordered tartare (both steak and salmon) as an appetizer, but all we could taste was mustard. Almost immediately after eating, we started feeling unwell. Even before we had finished our appetizers, the staff rushed to serve our main courses and began clearing plates while some of us were still eating.

The main courses were even worse. The so-called ‚Äúpizza‚Äù had barely a drop of tomato sauce, making it completely dry and tasteless. The quesadilla consisted of nothing but dry chicken‚Äîno seasoning, no sauce, nothing. The pasta was the only thing remotely edible, but that‚Äôs hard to mess up.

When they came to take our plates, we immediately told them the food was terrible. Instead of addressing the issue, four staff members, none of whom spoke a word of English, became visibly annoyed and defensive. We tried to find a solution, requesting a partial discount due to the awful food, but we were left waiting for 20 minutes with no response.

Using Google Translate, we attempted to explain our concerns politely. However, the staff refused to listen, remained arrogant, and even threatened to call the police while glaring at us. After 40 minutes of frustration, we gave up and paid the full bill for the worst food and service we‚Äôve ever experienced.

As if the experience wasn‚Äôt bad enough, four out of six people in our group vomited after leaving, and three ended up with food poisoning.

This place is a disaster. Terrible food, rude and unprofessional service, and zero accountability. Do yourself a favor and stay far away!","2025-02-02","Jai Visser"

"2","ChIJ3STtHXApQg0Rj3TMcsFf4qA","4","Really nice rooftop where you only pay what you consume, no entry fee!

It does get very busy sometimes so one of the times we went (Saturday evening) we had to wait in line for a while.

Nice atmosphere with music, string lights, and decorations.

The waiters in general are nice, smiley and friendly but on more than one occasion the service was a bit slow, even to pay the bill we had to ask a couple of times as they kept forgetting to bring it over, and it was what seemed a relaxed evening.

One downside was that if you‚Äôre not in the covered area of the rooftop (under the tapestry) it does get a bit cold if there‚Äôs some wind, the heat lamps were mainly under the shaded area.

Cocktails where always good when I went with friends, we never tried the food but it smelled great.

Apart from these two disadvantages I recommend this place, prices are what they are, but you‚Äôre also paying for a cocktail on a rooftop in Gran Via, so it‚Äôs understandable.","2024-08-28","Julie"

As Americans spending some time in Madrid, we were offended and disappointed by a hotel chain that has always surprised us with its extreme customer service in every corner of the world: Four Seasons.

This weekend, taking advantage of the fact that we were passing by the Four Seasons Hotel in Madrid, we decided to go in and have a coffee. From the beginning we felt unwelcome:

- They took a long time to serve us, we had to call someone to come and get us.
- The waiter came and the first thing he asked us was the room number of the hotel, we told him we were not staying there and he quickly changed his attitude.
- He brought us the American coffee and tea we had ordered. It was to be expected that because of the place (and the price, almost 30 euros) they would be served with the appropriate teapot and a pitcher of water for the Americano. But no, everything was served directly in the cups. By the way, the smallest American coffee I have ever had.
- As soon as we finished our drinks, the waiter came over and asked us if he could take everything away, as if he was in a hurry for us to leave.

So that's what we did, we left with the idea of never going back to that place again. Such an attitude and service made us think that maybe the hotel cafeteria is only for guests, but then they should say so from the beginning.

An unfortunate experience in a hotel chain that is known for its elegance and kindness. Sincerely, anywhere in the world except except in Madrid.","2024-10-27","Naig Gar"

The rabo de toro pad thai was a trip, a very successful fusion of two cuisines - and those two dishes are some of my favourites!

They also have their own cocktails, so of course I had to have one! I only tried the You & Me and it was really delicious, bitter and a little sweet.

üçä Seabass in Bilbao style was amazing.

üçã The iberico pork came with interesting and yummy sauce.  The service was pretty effective and very professional.

What can be improved:

‚ô° We ordered mille-feuille for dessert and it was really disappointing. The waiting time was long. The dough was hard, dense like a hard, thick puff rather than light. The cream was also hard and blandly sweet [ plus there was something taste like egg stood out too much...I don't know what it was but it reduces the sweet scent of the dish]. Personally, I felt like it lack of contrast of texture in the mouth. The ice cream that served with this dessert was pretty nice.","2025-02-22","Kansala Wanuntho"
"2","ChIJc3SHJZMpQg0RxLiMtjl-9EA","4","This fusion restaurant is situated on the flat floor of the five-star Marriott Hotel. According to its website, the menu is crafted by a two Michelin-starred chef. The staff is very welcoming and provides detailed descriptions of the dishes in both English and Spanish.

We tried the Nigiri de steak tartar crujiente, Tartar de salm√≥n con aguacate, and Solomillo de ternera a la brasa con verduras salteadas. All the ingredients were fresh, and the flavors met expectations, though they weren‚Äôt particularly outstanding. For dessert, we ordered the Flan de caf√© con helado de toffee y sal and Coulant de chocolate y pistacho con helado de violeta.

This restaurant is a solid choice for tourists or business dinners, offering a cozy ambiance. However, the food doesn‚Äôt fully justify the price.

"3","ChIJc3SHJZMpQg0RxLiMtjl-9EA","4","A Mixed Brunch Experience at Q√ö by Mario Sandoval in Madrid

Q√ö by Mario Sandoval, situated inside the JW Marriott in the heart of Madrid, near Plaza del Sol, offers an intriguing dining experience with a notable connection to the renowned two Michelin-starred restaurant, Coque. However, during our brunch visit, the restaurant left us with mixed feelings. Hopefully, a regular dinner or lunch gives its best.

Location and Ambience:
The restaurant's location is undeniably convenient, especially for tourists exploring the lively heart of Madrid. The modern and tasteful decor creates an inviting atmosphere, making it an ideal spot for a leisurely meal.

Food and Menu:
At Q√ö, the brunch is organized as a set menu, which includes a variety of dishes and small pastries. While the quality of the ingredients used in the dishes cannot be faulted, our overall dining experience fell slightly short of the high expectations set by Mario Sandoval's culinary reputation.

The brunch menu, priced at 65 euros per person, offers a range of options, but the standout elements were the small pastries and desserts. The pastries were excellent and the desserts were arguably the highlight of the entire meal. The inclusion of jam√≥n from the buffet was a nice touch, adding a traditional Spanish element to the meal.

Service:
Where Q√ö truly excels is in its service. The staff was impeccably professional and courteous throughout our visit. They contributed significantly to the overall positive aspects of the experience.

Value for Money:
Considering the location, the quality of ingredients, and the overall dining experience, the brunch menu at 65 euros per person can be seen as a fair offering. However, it teeters on the edge of being slightly overpriced, especially when compared to the diverse dining options available in Madrid at similar or even lower price points.

Final Verdict:
In conclusion, Q√ö by Mario Sandoval is a suitable choice for those seeking a flavorful brunch in a convenient, central location. While the quality of ingredients and the dessert section do not disappoint, the overall experience may not fully live up to the reputation of Mario Sandoval and his two Michelin stars. The restaurant's modern decor and excellent service are notable highlights, but for some diners, the pricing may make it more of an occasional treat rather than a regular haunt. It may not be the top choice for brunch enthusiasts in Madrid, but it certainly offers a unique culinary experience with a touch of elegance.","2023-10-16","Rocco Longo"

As for the dinner, it was good. I got the cow rib with roasted vegetables.  The vegetables were properly seasoned and the rib was cooked perfectly.  My wife got the mushroom rice with sweet potato fries and she also enjoyed her meal. For dessert we both got the pannacotta and it was a bright and vibrant dish with just the right amount of sweetness.  We‚Äôd eat there again.

My visit to Delito Madrid was nothing short of extraordinary. From the moment I stepped in, the elegant yet relaxed ambiance set the stage for a truly memorable evening.

What really stood out was the impeccable service. Carlos, our host for the night, was nothing less than spectacular. His warm demeanor and deep knowledge of the menu made our experience feel personal and special. He took the time to recommend dishes and even shared interesting stories about the origins of some of the ingredients.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the food‚Äîit was divine. The scallops were a masterpiece. Perfectly seared, with a delicate hint of kimchi that added just the right amount of heat and tang. Every bite melted in my mouth, and it was clear that only the freshest ingredients were used.

The highlight, however, was the seafood platter. The octopus was tender and flavorful, cooked to perfection with just the right smoky char.
Delito isn‚Äôt just a restaurant; it‚Äôs an experience. The attention to detail, from the beautifully plated dishes to the seamless service, made me feel like a valued guest.

This cocktail bar is super imaginative and well decorated. My friend and I stayed at the bar and got a few drinks and we had such a great conversation. The ambience helped with that. The crowd inside is a bit older but if you go there with someone you are already familiar with, you will be fine. Something I have to mention is that the state of the bathroom was great! Bars and clubs here in Spain tend to have their bathrooms in the worst condition so I was grateful that this bar maintained it so well. One con about the place was that the downstairs dance floor was EMPTY! My friend and I felt like dancing after a few drinks and we went to check it out and immediately came back up because there were only like 2 people dancing. I think the crowd is just older so they are less inclined to dance. If you want to party, this is not the place to go to. If you want a chill night with fun drinks and good conversation, this is the perfect place! The bartender (Sara?) was also super attentive and very professional. I would say that this is a less touristy and just as high quality as salmon guru and bad company 1920. It just depends if you want a more youthful hip crowd(salmon guru) or a speakeasy experience(bad company 1920) If you are just basing it on drinks, then Lovo cocktail bar is a good place to go to skip the lines and tourists.","2024-12-29","alessandra diaz"

"1","ChIJ65hr35YpQg0R7DjjTtuhkaU","5","As someone is still trying to understand natural wine, this was exactly the wine store I needed to visit.

The owners were superb, welcoming me as if I was a local.

I heard all about the natural wines in Spain, some of the history behind them and their creators. And I walked out the door with a few of the local natural wines under my arm (to take back to Australia).

Cannot recommend enough if you‚Äôre looking for Spanish natural wine!!","2024-06-21","Nathan"

Too bad since the place is nice and the wines in the flights were well considered.  Maybe we caught them on a down day, understaffed, or with a needy table that demanded all their attention.  Even so, what should have been a fabulous tasting for >90‚Ç¨ for two people, left us frustrated and disappointed.","2025-02-21","Stuart Baum"

But looks is not the only thing that appeals here - the selection of natural wines is well curated and there‚Äôre usually several opened bottles on offer. The vibe is nice slash cool, you‚Äôd really want to stay longer.

Small snacks and desserts, all reasonably priced. Easily the best natural wine bar in the area!

Just a piece of advice: pickled onions and Cornichons don‚Äôt go too well with natural wine (they are served as a little antipasti with your drink).","2025-02-16","Jana K"

There are a few little bodegas springing up around here, and this is certainly one of the best. Great wine and nibbles in a beautifully redesigned cosy nook. The wines are carefully selected and cover a variety of tastes, from traditional Spanish whites and reds (try the godello ;-)) to natural wines from Madrid and beyond, as well as a range of sherries. The waiting staff is warm and welcoming - Anita is delightful. Friday and Saturday evenings can get very busy, so enjoy best during the day when the crowds dwindle.","2024-05-19","Thomas John McMaw"

"1","ChIJZ1wtJHkoQg0R49vfA5eOhKk","5","I'm surprised with the negative reviews. I had a great time here. I went back three times in three days tasting many different by-the-glass wines: cavas, blancos and tintos.

As to be expected, quality is a function of price. I tasted a really excellent Valdeorras Reserva which at ‚Ç¨16 is 3 times the cost of their regular tintos (and 3 times the cost of a bottle of Campo Viejo in El Corte Ingles, but I would not touch that) but it was served in a proper bigger glass to savor all its complexities. I couldn't finish a bottle anyway so it was a deal for me.

When I went back the next time, I asked for tintos that were similar in quality to the Valdeorras and they recommended me two Ribera del Dueros which were excellent too. Next I asked for their ""good"" blanco and it was similarly excellent.

I'm Asian with an Asian face and I was not discriminated or anything. And yes, you could eat your pintxos on their desk if you asked them.","2024-10-05","Rudy Sujanto"
"2","ChIJZ1wtJHkoQg0R49vfA5eOhKk","1","Really horrible service from a very unpleasant, arrogant man, who when asked for a menu said ""I am the menu"".

"2","ChIJoYayDoEoQg0RMEqKDjbUhCs","5","Easily one of my favorite spots in Madrid, and one of the most unique. They have five sherries on deck (served from the barrels) and a simple but amazing list of tapas to pair them with. Highly recommend pairing the ""fino"" or ""Manzanilla"" sherries (these are the lighter ones) with a side of mojama (cured tuna). The palo cortado, amontillado and oloroso are all very interesting, but very pungent, so ask for a taste before ordering one.

This old school spot has a strict no-photo policy, so follow the rules and enjoy your stay at this Madrid institution!","2024-11-17","Gabriel Agostini"

"4","ChIJoYayDoEoQg0RMEqKDjbUhCs","4","On a walk home after dinner came upon this shop and decided to stop in for sherry. Loved the ‚Äúno cameras‚Äù signs everywhere, clearly they are trying to ward off the instagram influencer masses and it works. It seemed like a meeting place for friends.

Sherry/manzanilla was about 2 euros, with a few different options. They also brought you olives and peanuts and had a few snacks for purchase. They don‚Äôt accept even small tips. Paid in cash, wasn‚Äôt sure if they even take a card.

You can sort of imagine not much has changed in a 100 years in this place. Seemed like a special little place. Service was good, they track your tab using chalk on the bar.","2024-07-31","Melanie Smith"

An older bar man who looked at me without any expression whatsoever and expected me to know that was my invitation to order and then a young woman who was unbelievably rude because I tried to order two portions of salchichon in Spanish and I guess I didn‚Äôt get it quite right. Totally ruined the experience and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going here if you are a tourist. They seemed quite jovial with the other clientele-all of whom were Spanish.","2025-02-02","Emily"

"2","ChIJ2z8TbywmQg0RHVnx4UCblM4","3","Didn't like that the restaurant required a 30 Euro deposit to reserve a table for 7 people. The service was  slow. It wasn't the server's fault he hadn't been properly trained to answer some basic questions about the dishes. The atmosphere was very nice, comfortable, and a place you can have some good conversations without a lot of noise.
The food was very tasty, just not very generous portions; we would have liked a little more for the mains that cost ‚Ç¨15-17 each. We especially liked the Parmigiana di Melanzane and Flautas de Patata.
Although the mango ""crumble"" wasn't what you'd expect, the desserts were good, at ‚Ç¨8 each, higher than the average, but I guess that's necessary when they're only using plant-based ingredients.","2024-11-24","Thomas Biedermann"

For dessert we continued to share: an excellent mousse made with Peruvian chocolate.

They are still experimenting with wines from Argentina and we had a couple of glasses of a good full bodied red from Mendoza.

It‚Äôs a great hidden spot to grab a drink, have lunch or dinner, they accommodate bigger groups too. The place is modest but fulfills your every need, Diego who runs the place is very professional and courteous. We had the dadinhos de tapioca which were the star item, highly recommend! We also opted for the picanha meat and grilled chicken breast; they were great and the portions were generous. Definitely worth a try!","2023-10-30","A S"

My friend also loved her chicken plate. It is one of the best restaurants in Madrid. The place is cozy and they have a very friendly staff.","2024-08-15","F XF"
